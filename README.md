# LibraryProject---JavaFxFrontend
A fantastically fun school project that was created alongside some good friends of mine. This was recently added late since the oroginal repository was not on my personal github. 

Hey, you! Don't try to compile and run this project! This is but one of three separate projects, a frontend that requires its backend and database to function as intended. It is here to serve as an evaluation of programming knowledge in regards to Spring boot communication as well as the JavaFX GUI framework, it may be something interesting to go through, but won't do much good on its own!
